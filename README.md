# AT3-4
Data Structures Outcome 4

Develop and test a small program that uses standard collection classes
Your task here is to complete the attached File Extensions application.
The program is intended to store file extensions as a key and the associated program as the value. You 
will need to create an appropriate instance variable to store the file extension entries as a key pair value 
where the file extension is the key and the default program is the value. You should use an appropriate 
generic standard collection class with both the key and the value stored as string objects. You should 
then complete methods as detailed in the internal documentation (see: section "Starter code supplied").
Once you have completed the implementation, you should run the attached partial acceptance test to 
ensure that the program behaves as expected. You should also document any errors found and how you 
fixed the errors.
Please upload the following files: your Java source code (typically 2 files: one for the implementation and 
one for the testing), and screenshots of the program at runtime (in particular, the _output_ window ie 
the console).
